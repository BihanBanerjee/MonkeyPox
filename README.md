# Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning model that detects MonkeyPox in humans using clinical data. MonkeyPox is a rare and highly contagious viral disease that is similar to smallpox. The model uses an ensemble methodology of deep learning techniques. It is based on our paper under major revision in PLOS One journal
#Data
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of clinical data from patients diagnosed with MonkeyPox. The data includes skin lesion images. The data is available [Click Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nafin59/monkeypox-skin-lesion-dataset)

#Code

The model is implemented using Python and the following libraries:

Tensorflow
Keras
Sklearn
Pandas

The code in this repository can be used to train the model on new data or to make predictions on unseen data. To use the model, you will need to have Python and the listed libraries installed on your machine.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```
git clone https://github.com/BihanBanerjee/MonkeyPox.git
```
Follow the instructions in the code to train the model or make predictions
